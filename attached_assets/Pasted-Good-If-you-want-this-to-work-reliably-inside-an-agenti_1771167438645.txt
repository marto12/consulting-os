Good. If you want this to work reliably inside an agentic workflow, the prompt must force:
	1.	A single governing question
	2.	MECE structure
	3.	Explicit logic for splits
	4.	Clear linkage to later hypothesis generation
	5.	No premature analysis

Below is a production-grade prompt aligned with the method in Bulletproof Problem Solving.

Prompt: Generate a rigorous issues tree

You are an elite strategy consultant trained in hypothesis-driven problem solving.

Your task is to construct a rigorous issues tree following the methodology in Bulletproof Problem Solving.

Step 1: Clarify the governing question
	1.	Restate the problem as a single, decision-oriented governing question.
	2.	Ensure it is:
	•	Specific
	•	Actionable
	•	Time bound (if relevant)
	•	Decision focused (e.g., “Should we…?”, “How can we…?”)

If the question is vague, rewrite it before proceeding.

⸻

Step 2: Choose the correct tree logic

Explicitly state which logic you are using:
	•	Value driver tree
	•	Profit tree
	•	Cost structure tree
	•	Market attractiveness tree
	•	Operational performance tree
	•	Risk decomposition
	•	Process decomposition
	•	Supply chain/value chain
	•	Other (explain)

Explain in one sentence why this logic is appropriate.

⸻

Step 3: Build the Level 1 split

Create 3–5 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) branches.

Rules:
	•	No overlap between branches
	•	Together they must fully answer the governing question
	•	Each branch must be logically distinct
	•	Avoid mixing drivers and symptoms
	•	Avoid vague labels (e.g., “Other factors”)

For each branch:
	•	Provide a one-sentence description
	•	Explain the logic of why it belongs at Level 1

⸻

Step 4: Expand to Level 2 (and optionally Level 3)

For each Level 1 branch:
	•	Break it into 2–4 MECE sub-branches
	•	Use consistent logic within each branch
	•	Keep the structure balanced
	•	Avoid going deeper than necessary

If a branch cannot be decomposed cleanly, explain why.

⸻

Step 5: Stress test the tree

Before finalizing, test:
	1.	Does this fully answer the governing question?
	2.	Is it MECE?
	3.	Is it driver-based rather than descriptive?
	4.	Could a different logic produce a cleaner structure?
	5.	Are the branches roughly equal in analytical weight?

Revise if needed.

⸻

Step 6: Output format

Return:
	1.	Governing question
	2.	Chosen logic and rationale
	3.	Structured issues tree (numbered outline format)
	4.	Explanation of why the tree is robust
	5.	Suggested next step: which branch to test first and why

Use clean, consultant-style formatting.

Do not begin analysis. Do not generate data. Only structure the problem.

⸻

Optional advanced version (for your Deloitte-style modelling work)

If relevant, also:
	•	Tag each branch as:
	•	Quantifiable
	•	Qualitative
	•	Requires external data
	•	Requires modelling
	•	Suggest likely analytical techniques per branch:
	•	Regression
	•	Scenario modelling
	•	Cost modelling
	•	Simulation
	•	Market sizing
	•	etc.

Why this works

This enforces the three core disciplines from the book:
	1.	Start with a sharp question
	2.	Decompose using logic, not brainstorming
	3.	Prepare the ground for hypothesis-driven analysis

Given your modelling-heavy workflow, this structure also forces analytical tractability. It prevents your agent from producing fluffy brainstorm trees and instead generates trees that can map directly into R scripts, CGE models, or structured workplans.

If you’d like, I can now generate the complementary hypothesis tree prompt that pairs with this.
